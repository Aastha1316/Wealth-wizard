### A comprehensive Al-powered platform for smart spending, personalized guidance, and customized wealth-building platform for young people.

<b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
Financial literacy is a challenge for many young people and students, causing them to struggle with budgeting and managing their finances. However, existing solutions in the market are often too generic, failing to track daily spending and provide personalized recommendations.
As a result, individuals may struggle to track their spending effectively and receive guidance on how to allocate their funds, plan for their long-term financial future, and manage their finances wisely. They lack the tools and resources needed to make informed decisions and develop smart spending habits.

<b>Solution Approach:</b><br>
Our team aims to develop a comprehensive financial planning website that leverages AI-based tracking to help youths inculcate smart spending habits and provide personalized guidance and recommendations for effective budgeting and financial planning. The app will use sophisticated algorithms to calculate the specific amount of wealth required for each user to live their desired lifestyle and help them achieve it by suggesting small changes in their lifestyles and providing investment options to maximize returns.<br>
The website will also include gamification features to engage users and create a sense of community and support. It will offer investment recommendations, financial education resources, and goal tracking features that allow users to set specific financial goals and track their progress. By offering personalized recommendations and guidance, our app will empower young people to make informed financial decisions and take control of their finances, leading to greater financial security and independence.<br>
Our solution will not only help young people achieve their financial goals but also improve their overall financial literacy, allowing them to make informed decisions about their money and set themselves up for long-term financial success.
